# Employee Retention
The project is from the book [A collection of Data Science Take-home Challenges](https://datamasked.com/).

## Project Intro/Objective
In this project, the data set has info about the employees and I will h predict when employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn.

The data is from a few companies and includes all employees who joined from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13. For each employee, we also know if they are still at the company as of 2015/12/13 or they have quit. Beside that, we have general info about the employee, such as avg salary during her tenure, dept, and yrs of experience. As said above, the goal is to predict employee retention and understand its main drivers.

Objectives:
* Assume, for each company, that the headcount starts from zero. Estimate employee headcount, for each company. 
* What are the main factors that drive employee churn? Do they make sense? Explain your findings.

### Methods Used
* Decision Tree Model
